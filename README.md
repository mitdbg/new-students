# Welcome to MIT DB Group!
If you're a new student you should introduce yourself to the rest of the group! Please don't feel shy about going around our group's labs and getting everyone's name and what they do.

To get you access to various things, send the following to **Joana M. F. Trindade** (jmf@csail.mit.edu):

1. the email address you want to use for the group mailing list, <db@csail.mit.edu>,
2. your GitHub username,

After you've done this, you'll have access to the [Getting started guide](https://github.com/mitdbg/wiki/blob/master/new-student-getting-started.md) on the MIT DB group wiki, which you should read all the way through.

_note for current students: go through the [new student checklist](https://github.com/mitdbg/wiki/blob/master/onboarding/new-student-checklist.md)_
